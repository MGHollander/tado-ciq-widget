A [Garmin Connect IQ widget](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/overview/)
to display information from your tado째 smart thermostat on your Garmin
device.

This is still a work in progress. New features will be introduced in the future.
If you have questions, ideas or found a bug, please
[create an issue](https://github.com/MGHollander/tado-ciq-widget/issues/new/choose).

The widget depends on data from the
[tado째 Connect IQ bridge](https://github.com/MGHollander/tado-ciq-bridge).
This API serves tailored made data data to make the traffic as fast as possible.

*This widget is not build by tado째.*

## Features

- An overview of the current temperature, the set temperature and the humidity
  in your zones.
- Navigate through all zones, separate from each other.
- If you have multiple homes then the widget will ask you to choose a home from
  which the zones will be displayed (it is not yet possible to change to
  another home).

## Device support

At this moment the widget is in alpha phase and only supports the Fenix 5 plus.
Support for other devices will be added  in the future.

You are free to download the source of the widget and compile it for your own
device. It is not tested (yet) on any other device then the Fenix 5 plus though.

## Installation

- Download the package for your device from the
  [releases page](https://github.com/MGHollander/tado-ciq-widget/releases).
- Connect your device to your computer using a USB cable.
- Place the package in the `Garmin/Apps` folder on your device.

## Notes

- The main screen might not display all zones. You can sort the zones in the
  Tado app.

## Development

You can add your own features if you like. If you want to extend the features of
the API, then you need to be able to access it over a global reachable secure
connection. You can use [Expose](https://beyondco.de/docs/expose/introduction)
to make your development environment available for the widget. Change the
BaseUrl in TadoApp.mc to the Expose URL to test.

## Todo

- Add support for
- Read and apply
  - Debugging (https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/core-topics/debugging/)
  - Unit testing (https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/core-topics/unit-testing/)
  - Exception Reporting Tool (https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/core-topics/exception-reporting-tool/)
  - Publishing to the Store (https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/core-topics/publishing-to-the-store/)
- Use System.error() to report errors in the production app.
- Create issues for all other todo items.
- A -2 error pops up every now and then when the device is not connected to a
  phone.
- Check code style/formatting rules.
- Check if all web requests use the TadoTransaction.
- Replace the hidden access modifier for protected, since hidden is just a
  synonym..
- Use the screen height to determine how many zones can be displayed on the
  screen.
- Test the 401 handling in the onReceive method of TadoTransaction. Is this
  working as expected?
- Test the error handling in the accessCodeResult method of the login
  transaction. Is this working as expected?
- Remove all debug information.
- ~Move the app code into a separate dir and move unused images from the app dir
  to a separate dir (possible in Eclipse, but not in VS code).~
